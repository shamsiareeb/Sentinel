find multiple .txt files, each file representing a post. Each file will contain comments, alongside those
comments you will find whether the comment is positive, negative, neutral, or non analysable.
At the end of the comments, there is Summary for that particular post which contains URL for the post,
number of positive comments, number of negative comments, number of neutral comments and number
of non analysable comments.
